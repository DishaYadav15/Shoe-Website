# Shoe Website

Welcome to the Shoe Website,
a learning project built using Tailwind CSS and inspired by the Javascript Mastery tutorials.

## Description

This project serves as a frontend-only implementation of a shoe website. It was developed as a part of my web development learning journey. The website showcases various shoe products and provides a simple user interface for browsing.

## Features

- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Product showcase with images and details.

## Future Plans

I plan to enhance this project by adding the following features:

- **Backend Integration:** Implement server-side functionality to handle user authentication, product management, and other dynamic features.
- **User Authentication:** Allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Product Filtering and Sorting:** Improve the user experience by adding options to filter and sort products.
- **Shopping Cart:** Implement a shopping cart functionality for users to add products and proceed to checkout.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Enable secure online transactions with payment gateway integration.
